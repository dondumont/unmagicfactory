<h1>Unsanctioned Magic</h1>
Do you like playing Magic: The Gathering? Do you like to hobnob? Do you have an incommunicable interest in the occult? Have you ever felt alone? If you answered yes to any of these questions, Unsanctioned Magic is for you.

Unsanctioned Magic hosts MtG events in cool places all over Portland with an emphasis on the gathering bit. Our goal is to have events that are just as much fun to win as they are to lose. Join us, won't you?

<h1>Types of events</h1>

<h3>Swig N' Sealed</h3>
Swig N' Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/sealed-deck">Sealed Magic</a>, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set, as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive.

<h3>Drafts and Draft</h3>
Drafts and Draft hangs at one great location while we play <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft">Magic Draft</a>. Sometimes a friendly ghost supplies the packs, sometimes you will need to bring your own. This event is all ages unless it says that it ain't. Make sure to check the event details page.
