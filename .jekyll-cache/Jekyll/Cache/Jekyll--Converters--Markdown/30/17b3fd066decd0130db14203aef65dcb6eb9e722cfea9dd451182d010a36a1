<p>Weâ€™re doing it! Come enjoy the breathtaking experience of drafting a multi-player commander set while maybe sipping on something to take the edge off. Life is just too real sometimes, ya know? Weâ€™ll split into pods of 4 after the draft and play a round. One round?!, you might be screaming. Yes. Well, officially only one because commander takes a long time but if folks want to hang for another round we can probably be persuaded.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to bring 3 Baldurâ€™s Gate draft boosters with you and some basic lands. Sleeves and a playmat if you want to get fancy.</p>
