<p>How many cats do you know? Can you say you really know them, their true intentions? Exactly. You can’t. No matter how they present, Magic has taught us that they are actually deceit driven murder machines just waiting for their moment. But who among us isn’t? The brilliance of MtG’s latest story arc is that it pulls back the curtain on all our souls, exposing us, raw, soft, bloated on ineffective treats meant to distract us from the image of ourselves recoiling at our own reflection. But we can’t let that stop us. We set out to claim the life of someone who who loves us, and goddammit, we’re going to do it!</p>

<p><b>What is Swig N’ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
