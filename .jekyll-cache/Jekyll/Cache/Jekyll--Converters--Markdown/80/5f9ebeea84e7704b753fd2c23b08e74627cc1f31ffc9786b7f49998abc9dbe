<p>All will be one? Oh, Elesh Norn, you sweet, innocent, summer child. Canâ€™t you see? We are already one. We are infinite oneness. From the smallest Light of Tecate to the deepest Folds of Malort, we are enmeshed in a single cosmic fabric. What you have failed to understand we have known since time eternal, or at least since Battle for Zendikar. Free yourself from ignorance and join us, wonâ€™t you? In truth, you already have.</p>

<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
