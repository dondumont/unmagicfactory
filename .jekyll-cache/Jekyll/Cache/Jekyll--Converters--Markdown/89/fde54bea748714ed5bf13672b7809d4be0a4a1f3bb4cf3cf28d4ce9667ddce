<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
