I"#<h1>Changes to Swig N' Sealed!</h1>
<p>Who doesn’t love change? Change is the biggest reason we became a wizard. Now we can transform almost antything we want into a change machine, anytime. No more scrounging for quarters on robe wash week. With that in mind, here’s what’s going down.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swig N’ Sealed events will now be capped at 3 rounds with a built in afterparty/award ritual!</li>
  <li>There will now be Unsanctioned Seasons that consist of 4 Swig N’ Sealed events (assuming a normal set release sched).</li>
</ul>
