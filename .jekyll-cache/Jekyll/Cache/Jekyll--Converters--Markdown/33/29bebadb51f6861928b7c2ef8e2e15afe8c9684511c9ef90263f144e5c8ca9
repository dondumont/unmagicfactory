I"“<p>Whatâ€™s old is new again. The Wheel of Becoming turns and where do we find ourselves? We find ourselves in the Bardo of cyberspace. Do not become distracted. Do not. Become. Distracted. Cast down fear and realize these demons are only the remnants of your physical body. Youâ€™re safe now. Even though you werenâ€™t able to close the womb entrance weâ€™re here for you with a brand new website!</p>
