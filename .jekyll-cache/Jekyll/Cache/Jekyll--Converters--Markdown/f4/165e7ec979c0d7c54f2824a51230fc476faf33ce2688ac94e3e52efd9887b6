<p>I bet you think a lot about dying. Itâ€™s near impossible not to these days with all war, pollution, and duende creeping through the windows to whisper dark nothings from the negative dimension beneath your pillow. Sure, thatâ€™s all sexy and good but what would it be like to go beyond death? What would it feel like to transmute the dull lump of wilting flesh you are now into a being of pure party energy? A being only hinted at in the Book of Enoch and rumored to be tattooed on the inner thigh of Zosimos. It probably feels exactly like playing Swig Nâ€™ Sealed. Transcend with us.</p>

<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive.</p>
