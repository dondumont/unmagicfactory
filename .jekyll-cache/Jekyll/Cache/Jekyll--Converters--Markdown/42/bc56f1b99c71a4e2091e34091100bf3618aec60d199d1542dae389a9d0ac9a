<p>There is no telling what you do not know. Like speakeasy patrons, the unknown carouses in some hidden district buried within the city of your heart. The time has finally come. No longer can you lie awake in your tiny bed full of Taki crumbs and mascara tears wondering what more could be out there. Don your brilliant flapper dress* and blaze into the night to find the unknown! Join us. Weâ€™re waiting for you below that neon part of yourself that you choose to keep hidden.</p>

<p>*the one you thought looked so good online but have been too afraid to wear out</p>

<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
