<p>How the time flies! Seems like just yesterday we were rolling up our wizard sleeves and digging frozen toads out of the frost for our Babylonian Tea Ceremony and now Spring is upon us. That means weâ€™ve got another invite-only Unsanctioned Magic event coming up for our <s>cult</s> Patreon members! Come. Join us. Find your true power. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/unsanctionedmagic">Become a Patron</a> at any level to get invites. Thanks to the internet, we donâ€™t even require a blood sacrifice anymore. Youâ€™re already giving more than you know.</p>
