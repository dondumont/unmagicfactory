<p>Our route, split between South and North Portland, symbolizes the divide that all twins feel. There is nothing in any reality more polarized than the relationship between twin siblings. During birth, the agape organ is split between each twin which makes it impossible for either to feel love, tell time or make a sandwich for another person. Further more, being in proximity to one another is similar to magnets of identical charge being forced together. The resulting discordant current, which feels and smells similar to old ice skates being rubbed together, can not only be felt by the twins but also by small babies, dragonflies and most single aunts. Distortions in the surrounding air can be observed by the average human from as far as 3 meters away. It’s for this reason, as we all know, that most people destroy their twin before the age of 11. Less commonly known is what happens to those twins who do not eliminate their weaker half. Wilds of Eldraine tells the tale in exquisite detail with a valuable lesson for us all. That lesson is to come to Swig N’ Sealed, where even a twin can feel whole, if only for a little while. Join us. Be whole again.</p>

<p><b>What is Swig N’ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
