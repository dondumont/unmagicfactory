<p>Staggering, blood and oil mix to create a muddy gel that slides beneath your feet. Vision blurs with the pounding of your head but there is no sound. No birds, no running water, no faint breeze, no exhalation of small children. Even your own breath seems muted, distant, like the accidental eye contact of an ex-lover at the spaghetti restaurant. You wanted the fighting to stop. You wanted things to be quiet but is this what you really wanted? Yes. Yes, it is. You wanted to win Swig Nâ€™ Sealedâ€¦ and you got your wish.</p>

<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
