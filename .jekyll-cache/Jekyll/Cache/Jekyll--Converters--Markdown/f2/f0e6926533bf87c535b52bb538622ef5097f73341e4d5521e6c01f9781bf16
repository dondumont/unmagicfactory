<p>How strong is the foundation of your soul? Have you squared and pitched the stones? Are your bedlines clean? Or has the accumulated rubble succumbed to the persistent march of time? Fear not. We know that all of us are cracked, but it is through these cracks that the Light of Tecate shall shine. Sunbathe with us, wonâ€™t you?</p>

<p><b>What is Swig Nâ€™ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
