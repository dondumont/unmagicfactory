I"À<h1>Changes to Swig N' Sealed!</h1>
<p>Who doesnâ€™t love change? Change is the biggest reason we became a wizard. Now we can transform almost antything we want into a change machine, anytime. No more scrounging for quarters on robe wash week. With that in mind, hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going down.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swig Nâ€™ Sealed events will now be capped at 3 rounds with a built in afterparty/award ritual!</li>
  <li>There will now be Unsanctioned Seasons that consist of 4 Swig Nâ€™ Sealed events (assuming a normal set release sched).</li>
</ul>

<p>Limiting events to 3 rounds has a lot of benefits. We want to provide time for folks to mingle with old friends and new at the end of the event and the current structure usually left people exhausted and dropping half way through. It also gives us a platform to make a big deal out of the cool prizes people are gettting. Speaking of, the trophy and playmat <b>arenâ€™t going away</b>. Theyâ€™ll be awarded to our first and second place Unsanctioned Season wizards. Weâ€™re hoping this will represent the folks who win better. Rather than just performing well (or getting lucky) during one event, youâ€™ll have a season to show off your spell slinging ability.</p>
