<p>Once again, the whorey air of a long neglected murder mansion beckons you. Just like your parents, you cannot resist. It’s namesake, an apparition of greed, gold and pancake folds. It’s former master, a youthful centenarian, bent on cane cracking anyone who yucks on her yums. What mysteries will you uncover? Will you find the murderer? Can you love yourself? Answer all these questions and ask a whole lot more at Swig N’ Sealed 34: Murders At Karlov Manor.</p>

<p>Route: The Knock Back &gt; Hilt &gt; Donne Vegas</p>

<p><b>What is Swig N’ Sealed?</b><br /> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.</p>
