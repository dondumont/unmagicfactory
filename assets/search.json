It’s near impossible not to these days with all war, pollution, and duende creeping through the windows to whisper dark nothings from the negative dimension beneath your pillow. Sure, that’s all sexy and good but what would it be like to go beyond death? What would it feel like to transmute the dull lump of wilting flesh you are now into a being of pure party energy? A being only hinted at in the Book of Enoch and rumored to be tattooed on the inner thigh of Zosimos. It probably feels exactly like playing Swig N’ Sealed.

The current structure usually left people exhausted, falling off their toadstools with a fair few discorprating half way through. It also gives us a platform to make a big deal bestowing cool prizes to people (we just don’t get enough opportunities to yell at people).\n\nSpeaking of prizes, the trophy and playmat aren’t going away, and top place finishers from each event will still be recognized. The trophy and playmat will be awarded to our first and second place Unsanctioned Season wizards. We’re hoping this will represent folks better. Rather than just performing well or casting a luck charm during one event, you’ll have a season to show off your spell slinging ability. Or just forget about winning entirely if you want. Tracking things over a season gives us the opportunity to award other, non-win related superlatives to be announced later. *cough* sick nasty play of the day *cough cough*\n\nLet us know what you think in our Discord.
