Will its movement turn your soft heart into a Wal-Mart or will you be transmuted into a sinuous dragon? Will your unfeigned air wither and shrivel under the gaze of these vampires or will it temper your spirit into shimmering, dream-plated armor? Are you prepared?” These are all the things our father asked us when we turned four and now, we ask them to you. Whatever your reply, “You don’t come home until you’re a red sock!” Thanks, Dad. R.I.P.\n\nCome party with us as we celebrate Swig N’ Sealed turning four. Good folks, good drinks, good food and free stuff! Use this as an early stress test for your Halloween costume.\n\n\n\nWhat is Swig N’ Sealed? \nSwig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos).

It’s near impossible not to these days with all war, pollution, and duende creeping through the windows to whisper dark nothings from the negative dimension beneath your pillow. Sure, that’s all sexy and good but what would it be like to go beyond death? What would it feel like to transmute the dull lump of wilting flesh you are now into a being of pure party energy? A being only hinted at in the Book of Enoch and rumored to be tattooed on the inner thigh of Zosimos. It probably feels exactly like playing Swig N’ Sealed.
