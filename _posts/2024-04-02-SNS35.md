Finally, Wizards has given us what we've all been asking for, cacti with hats! How many years have we waited? How many sleepless nights have we spent carting stetsons to the local plant nursery? How much blood have we offered to Saguaro, The Ever Pointy? But after 100 expansions they're here! Bring your brushwag and join us in welcoming them, won't you?

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
