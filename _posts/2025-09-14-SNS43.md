Rejoice! The radioactive spider ritual we've been performing for decades has finally born fruit. Soon, the All-Seeing Eye shall open the multiverse to usher not only spiders (beautiful spiders), but also spider men. And don't be misled, these spider men aren't just men. They're woman, robots, pigs, clouds of sentient blood mist. Everything will be a spider man! Raise your eight limbs in our symbol of traditional praise and join us, won't you?

Route: TBA

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
