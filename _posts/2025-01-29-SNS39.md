You've clung for so long. Scraped. Clawed. Maybe even begged to the darkness of your solitary nights, in greasy exhalations, to hold tight to existence. No longer. We're offering you another path. Join us at Swig N' Sealed, where you can relinquish your lugubrious vigil and instead luxuriate in The Fifth Element's call. Will you set your soul loose and drift the aether with us? Find infinity in your release, forever fast, forever furious.

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
