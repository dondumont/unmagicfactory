To celebrate our 10th birthing, we're venturing to Shadowmoor (Twilight Cafe)!

Receive dawn’s primary cobalt proton direct to the ocular synapse and enter your new consciousness. Gaze out beyond the blinking router light and ask yourself: are you truly awake? If so, when did you go to sleep? Is it early morning or late evening? What direction does time Evenflow? Evenso, thoughts arrive like butterflies… in your tummy, tiny chrysalides requiring a steady drip of Tecate and liminal light to usher its eventual blossom. Such is the way of things these days and nights, going on a decade now… thats crazy. Join us, won't you?

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
