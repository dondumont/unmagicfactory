Another year passes as time continues it's inexorible march. Are you prepared? Will its movement turn your soft heart into a Wal-Mart or will you be transmuted into a sinuous dragon? Will your unfeigned air wither and shrivel under the gaze of these vampires or will it temper your spirit into a shimmering, dream-plated armor? Are <i>you</i> prepared? These are all the things our father asked us when <i>we</i> turned four and now, we ask them to you. Whatever your reply, "you don't come home until you're a red sock!" Thanks, Dad. R.I.P.

Come party with us as we celebrate Swig N' Sealed turning four. Good folks, good drinks, good food and free stuff!
 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set, as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive.
