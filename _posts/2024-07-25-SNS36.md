Raise your mighty acorns to the sky in defiance! For too long have we sat in the swamp-stench shadows of sweaty frogs. Their pimpled machinations blindly controlling our fate like a four year old administering its own pain medication. No more. We are beautiful and earnest warriors of the wind, of the soil, of the stars! And our mothers didn't die on their bloodied ribbit wreckers to see us crawl to these croakers. Join us in our battle cry, squeekity squeek squeeken!

Route: TBA

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
