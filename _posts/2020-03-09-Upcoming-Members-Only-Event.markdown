For the safety of everyone, this event and all upcoming events are suspended until further notice. We'll miss you like the deserts miss the rains but we look forward to seeing you all happy and healthy on the other side of this. If you were looking forward to our witty event intro we've left it below for posterity's sake.

How the time flies! Seems like just yesterday we were rolling up our wizard sleeves and digging frozen toads out of the frost for our Babylonian Tea Ceremony and now Spring is upon us. That means we've got another invite-only Unsanctioned Magic event coming up for our <s>cult</s> Patreon members! Come. Join us. Find your true power. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/unsanctionedmagic">Become a Patron</a> at any level to get invites. Thanks to the internet, we don't even require a blood sacrifice anymore. You're already giving more than you know.
