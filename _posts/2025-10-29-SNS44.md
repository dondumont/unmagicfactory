Your time spent fasting under a moonless, truck stop sky, caked in jade elixir, chanting the sacred syllables "Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya" is finally paying off. The elements shall cower before you like a neighbor kid before a stepsister. You no longer fear the lightning, it fears you. Steady your focus and join us in commanding the very fabric of existence to get bent, won't you?

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
