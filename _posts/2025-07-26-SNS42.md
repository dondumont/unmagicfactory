Finally! A set made in honor of the Void and we couldn't be happier. There is something special about doing magic in space. Maybe it's the utter silence that isn't truly silent. Maybe it's the sprawling nothing and crushing infinity spread out before you like all your misspent Sunday mornings that really get the spell juices flowing. Whatever it is, now is the time for you to join US where no one can hear you scream. Come along, won't you?

Route: Space Room Lounge > The Trough > Angelo's

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
