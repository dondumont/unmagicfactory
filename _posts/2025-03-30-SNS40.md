Through your fog of jalapeño poppers, the bruise-cloud sky beckons to you. The sound is cacophonous. Like an elementary school field day sponsored by some draconic ribbon dancers, the firmament is jamming with the air-slap of a million leathery wings. The time is now. Release yourself from your sweet chili shackles and press your soft flesh against the cleansing wind of a DRAGONSTORM!

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig N’ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
