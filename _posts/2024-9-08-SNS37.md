Put on your soft-meat birthday crown and get ready to party. Swig N' Sealed is turning 9! And what plane could be more appropriate for a 9-year-old than Duskmourn? Sure, we all know that time is an illusion created by greeting card companies to support the temporal industrial complex, but who doesn't like a nice piece of sponge cake filled with spiders every now and then? Venture from the haunted house of your mind to celebrate with us won't you?

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
