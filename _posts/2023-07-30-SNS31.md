In honor of the fellowship, we'll journey across Middle Portland, which some ignorant people might call Humboldt. We'll cover an unfathomable distance of nearly a mile as we cross over the Misty I-5 Mountains and sneak into the Mordor Room. Roll up your wizard sleeves, grip a sick walking stick and pack your pots for adventure!

Route: Satellite Tavern (Shire) > Red Fox (Lorien) > The Florida Room (Mordor)

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
