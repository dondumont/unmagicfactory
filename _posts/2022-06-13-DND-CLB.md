<b>COVID Requirements:</b> Proof of vaccination or negative COVID test may be required for some locations. Be sure to bring yours.<br>

We're doing it! Come enjoy the breathtaking experience of drafting a multi-player commander set while maybe sipping on something to take the edge off. Life is just too real sometimes, ya know? We'll split into pods of 4 after the draft and play a round. One round?!, you might be screaming. Yes. Well, officially only one because commander takes a long time but if folks want to hang for another round we can probably be persuaded.

You'll need to bring 3 Baldur's Gate draft boosters with you and some basic lands. Sleeves and a playmat if you want to get fancy.
