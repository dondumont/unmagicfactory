We know we said the last one was the final fantasy, but we really mean it this time. This is the final, final fantasy. Nothing but cold, oiled up, low-thread-count reality from now on. We've pierced the membrane of illusion and cannot unfeel, let alone unsee, what it has taught us. Will you brave the scent and join us?

<b>What is Swig N' Sealed?</b><br> 
Swig Nâ€™ Sealed is a pub crawl where we also play Sealed Magic, which means it is 21+ (sorry kiddos). You should bring your own packs from the corresponding set as well as basic lands. Compete for objects you ascribe value to and try to have more fun than anyone alive or dead.
